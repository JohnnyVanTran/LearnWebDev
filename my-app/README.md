# Personal website

Hi, and welcome to my personal website! This is a little guide of how you can run the project in a more user-friendly way (see, rather than having to read code) and what resources that have been used. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run the commando `npm install` so all dependencies are installed.

### `npm start`
After the above commando, you can run `npm start`, which will run the app in the development mode automatically on your web browser. 

## Resources

### Material UI

The design library Material UI (https://mui.com/material-ui/) have been used in this project for the purpose of components and icons.
